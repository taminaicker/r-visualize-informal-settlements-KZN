# Using R to Visualize Informal Settlements in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN)

## Overview

This project uses R to visualize informal settlements in KZN, South Africa. The project uses data from the eThekwini Strategic Hub, which provides information on the water supply, sanitation, electricity access, and other amenities available to informal settlements in KZN.

The visualizations can be used to answer questions about the lifestyle and amenities of informal settlements in KZN. For example, the visualizations can be used to identify which region of KZN has the most informal settlements or what the most common water supply source is. The visualizations can also be used to create awareness of the challenges faced by residents of informal settlements. For example, the visualizations can be used to show that a significant percentage of informal settlements do not have access to basic amenities such as electricity and sanitation.

The project aims to contribute to the understanding of informal settlements in KZN and to raise awareness of the challenges faced by residents. The project can be used by policymakers, researchers, and the general public to learn more about informal settlements and to advocate for improved conditions.

## Data
